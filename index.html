                <h1>Hello and welcome! I'm Victor Kuan.</h1>
                <p>Hey there! I'm Victor Kuan, and I'm a second year CSE student here at the UW. It's truly a dream come true that I get to study alongside some brilliant people here at this institution.  
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Java skills
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Being a CSE student, I've familiarized myself with some pretty interesting technologies this past year. Namely, I'm quite familiar with Java, its syntax, how to implement many of its important
                    datastructures (including AVLTree, Min/Max-Heaps, Tries, and more), and how to implement some clever sorts (including Quicksort, Mergesort, and Heapsort).
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Webdev experience
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Beyond Java, I've also familiarized myself 
                    with some webdev technologies and languages this past summer. I taught myself html, css, and some JavaScript (React.js, to be more specific). My favorite framework to work with is probably Bootstrap. 
                    It's so clean and simplistic, and the syntax is easy to learn about. To showcase my summer webdev learnings, I've created a few projects (including this portfolio blog page) and I'd like to share the 
                    projects with whoever is viewing this site.
                </p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Udubbed is a tips and tricks blog page that I've been working on, and it's supposed to a project where I compile some information (based on my own experience + things I've heard from friends + information I've read
                    on reddit) about how to succeed/live in happier, more efficient way at the UW. I'm still working on it, so a lot of the information hasn't been posted yet. Stay tuned. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project I used html and css, and to more efficiently style my page, I went with a Boostrap approach to deal with my css. I haven't finished the page yet (there's more information to be added), but it
                    still effectively showcases my competence with writing stuff in html, and then properly styling the site using css and frameworks.

                <p> I'm a human being and so I have some interests beyond just writing code on computers lol. I'm a tennis player, a YouTube content creator, and a food enthusiast
